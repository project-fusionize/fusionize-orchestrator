# üß© Architecture Overview ‚Äì Agentic BPM Platform

## üìò Summary

This project is an **open-source, distributed, agentic Business Process Management (BPM) platform** that brings together AI-driven orchestration, workflow flexibility, and a modular component ecosystem.

It allows developers to define **workflows as code** (called *Blueprints*) that dynamically coordinate **microservices** (called *Components*). These workflows can be adapted in real-time by an AI orchestrator, making business processes flexible, resilient, and context-aware.

The system‚Äôs purpose is to solve one of the major limitations of existing workflow tools ‚Äî rigidity. It enables workflows to ‚Äúbend without breaking,‚Äù dynamically adjusting paths, triggers, and decision rules during execution based on situational context or AI recommendations.

## üß± Core Concepts

### **Blueprints**

Blueprints are the logical definition of a process. They describe how tasks are connected, what triggers start a process, and how each step interacts with others.
They are version-controlled, human-readable, and can be dynamically edited during execution. This makes them far more adaptable than traditional BPM diagrams.

Blueprints may be stored as JSON, YAML, or database entries, and they can be reloaded or modified by the orchestrator ‚Äúin the air‚Äù ‚Äî without requiring container restarts or redeployments.

---

### **Components**

Components are **independent, discoverable microservices** that perform specific tasks ‚Äî such as sending emails, parsing documents, or making AI-based decisions.
Each component follows a standardized interface inspired by the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, allowing interoperability and discovery across the system.

Components register themselves with the orchestrator and can be invoked dynamically during a workflow‚Äôs execution. This enables a plug-and-play ecosystem where developers can build and share reusable services.

---

### **AI Orchestrator**

The orchestrator acts as the **central intelligence** of the platform. It interprets Blueprints, coordinates workflow execution, and communicates with registered Components.
It also manages state, handles failures, and allows AI agents to modify workflow behavior dynamically based on context or runtime data.

For example, if an approval workflow requires a manager who is unavailable, the orchestrator can adjust the workflow in real time to route approval to a director instead.

The orchestrator is backed by an AI reasoning layer that uses large language models for contextual understanding, process planning, and adaptive decision-making.

---

### **Registry Service**

The Registry acts as the **system‚Äôs directory of Components**.
It stores information about all registered Components, including their names, endpoints, capabilities, and health status.

The orchestrator queries the Registry to discover which Components are available and how to invoke them. This service forms the backbone of the platform‚Äôs modularity and openness.

---

## üß† Dynamic and Adaptive Workflows

Traditional workflow engines are static ‚Äî changes require redeployment or downtime.
In this system, workflows are designed to be **fluid**. They can evolve at runtime, guided by AI or conditional logic, allowing process flexibility that matches real-world complexity.

This adaptive model is particularly useful in human-in-the-loop systems, where workflows must consider context, exceptions, and alternate decision routes.

## üß© Architecture Layers

| Layer                | Technology                  | Description                                                   |
| -------------------- |-----------------------------| ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Orchestrator**     | Java Spring Boot            | Executes workflows, manages state, and coordinates Components |
| **Registry**         | MongoDB                     | Stores Component metadata and discovery information           |
| **Components**       | Containerized microservices | Implement MCP-like interfaces for reusable functionality      |
| **Blueprints**       | YAML or JSON                | Define process flows and logic                                |
| **AI Layer**         | LangChain or similar        | Enables reasoning, adaptive routing, and AI-based decisioning |
| **Containerization** | Docker or Kubernetes        | Ensures modular deployment and scalability                    |

## üß≠ Deployment Strategy

**Local Development:**
The orchestrator, registry, and a few sample Components can run via Docker Compose for rapid experimentation. MongoDB serves as the default storage backend.

**Production Environment:**
For distributed setups, orchestrator and Components can be deployed in Kubernetes clusters, with MongoDB or another persistent NoSQL store for workflow states and registry information.

Blueprints can be managed via GitOps, allowing version control, collaboration, and rollback capability.

---

## üîó Directory Structure Overview

The repository is divided into major sections for clarity and extensibility:

* A folder for Blueprints (workflow definitions)
* A folder for Components (modular microservices)
* The Orchestrator core service
* Registry service and database configuration
* Deployment assets such as Docker or Kubernetes manifests

---

## üöÄ Developer Experience & Open Source Model

This project is built with **developer collaboration in mind**.
Contributors can create their own Components, register them with the orchestrator, and integrate them into shared Blueprints.

Because the platform follows open standards and schema-driven design, onboarding is straightforward, and integration is consistent.
A future vision includes a **Component marketplace**, enabling developers to share, discover, and rate MCP-compatible modules.

---

## üß© Workflow Execution Flow

When a workflow runs:

1. An AI agent or event trigger initiates a Blueprint.
2. The orchestrator parses the Blueprint and loads its state.
3. The Registry identifies which Components are available for each step.
4. The orchestrator invokes Components, manages dependencies, and updates state.
5. The AI layer may modify the workflow logic dynamically if context changes.
6. Results and logs are persisted in the database for auditability and monitoring.

---

## ‚ö° Future Extensions

Planned capabilities include:

* A web dashboard for workflow visualization and live monitoring
* AI-assisted Blueprint authoring and autocompletion
* A public registry or marketplace for reusable Components
* Prometheus and Grafana integrations for observability
* Enterprise access control and multi-tenant orchestration
